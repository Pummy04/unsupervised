üß† Unsupervised Learning ‚Äì Full Theory
üìå Definition:
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns patterns from unlabeled data. It means the data doesn't have output labels ‚Äî the system tries to find hidden structures or relationships within the input data.

üß© Key Objective:
To discover patterns, groupings, or data distributions without knowing the correct answers (labels).

üîç How it works:
The algorithm looks at input features only.

It identifies clusters, associations, or dimensionality reductions.

No human intervention for data labeling is required.

‚ú≥Ô∏è Popular Algorithms:
1. Clustering
Used to group similar data points into clusters.

K-Means Clustering

Partitions data into K clusters based on distance (e.g., Euclidean).

Iteratively refines cluster centers (centroids).

Hierarchical Clustering

Builds a tree (dendrogram) of clusters.

Two types: Agglomerative (bottom-up), Divisive (top-down).

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

Groups data based on density of points.

Works well with irregular shapes and noise.

2. Dimensionality Reduction
Used to reduce the number of features in the dataset while preserving important information.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

Projects data onto new axes (principal components).

Keeps the directions with the most variance.

t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

Used for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D/3D.

3. Association Rule Learning
Used to discover relationships (associations) between variables in large datasets.

Apriori Algorithm

Finds frequent itemsets in transactional data (e.g., market basket analysis).

ECLAT Algorithm

Faster than Apriori using vertical data representation.
